# 1. Overview

In this take home exercise, we aim to provide critique and improvements based on the plots and analysis created by peers. It will be done based on clarity and aesthetics.

The focus of this exercise will be data preparation critique, data visualization critique and conclusion presentation critique.

# 2. Data Preparation Critique

In the initial data preparation phase, the student opted to create individual data frames, saving them to the local disk before reloading them for subsequent use. This introduced unnecessary steps, consuming considerable time whenever a dataframe was required.

The proposed data preparation streamlines the process by consolidating all data into a single stu_df. Extracting columns from stu_qqq_SG and merging them into stu_df results in a compact dataset that is quick and straightforward to read, significantly enhancing efficiency.

Improvements:

-   **Enhanced Distribution Comparison:**

    -   Violin plots combine aspects of boxplots and kernel density plots, providing a more comprehensive view of the data distribution.

    -   The width of the violin plot represents the density of scores, making it easier to compare distributions between genders.

    -   The presentation of grid lines enhance the clarity of presentation.

-   **Boxplot Insights:**

    -   Boxplots within the violin plot offer insights into the quartiles, median, and potential outliers, providing a summary of central tendency and spread. For example, we can observe that generally male students have a wider performance spread.

    -   Boxplots are effective in highlighting any gender-based differences in terms of median and spread. From the box plot with red dot representing mean score, we can conclude that the average performance of female and male are close. Female students have higher mean and median in `Reading`, male students have better performance in `Math` and `Science.`

-   **Outlier Detection:**

    -   The combination of violin and boxplots facilitates easy identification of outliers in each gender category. It can be observed that for each sub-plot, there are outliers at the lower end.

    -   Outliers can be crucial in understanding extreme scores and potential factors influencing them.

### 3.2.2 Makeover Design - Density plot of Top 3 and Bottom 2 Schools

The following is the proposed density plot of top 3 schools and bottom 2 schools.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
# Filter data for top 3 and bottom 2 schools
top_schools <- stu_df[stu_df$School_ID %in% c(70200003, 70200001, 70200101), ]
bottom_schools <- stu_df[stu_df$School_ID %in% c(70200115, 70200149), ]

# Create density plots
ggplot() +
  geom_density(data = top_schools, aes(x = Average_Score, fill = as.factor(School_ID)), alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_density(data = bottom_schools, aes(x = Average_Score, fill = as.factor(School_ID)), alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Density Plot of Top 3 and Bottom 2 Schools",
       x = "Average Score",
       y = "Density",
       fill = "School ID") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#FF69B4", "#6495ED", "#32CD32", "#FFD700", "#FF4500")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## 3.3 Students Performance Distribution by Home Possessions

### 3.3.1 Original design

The initial plot is clear and visually appealing. The only potential improvement that comes to mind is the red line running through the midpoint of each box plot's median. However, the line appears jagged, making it challenging to discern the pattern and trend in the relationship between score and the number of home possessions.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
ggplot(data = PV_Avg_HOMEPOS, aes(x = factor(Home_Possessions), y = Avg_PVOverall)) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.5, fill = "#D2B4E8") +
  stat_summary(fun = "median", geom = "line", aes(group = 1), color = "red", linewidth = 1) +  
  labs(x = "HOMEPOS", y = "Overall Score", title = "Distribution of Overall Scores by HOMEPOS") +
  theme_classic()
```

### 3.3.2 Makeover

This code chunk includes a smoothing line (geom_smooth) using the `loess` method, providing a visual representation of the trend in the relationship between `HOMEPOS` and `Average_Score`. This can be useful for identifying overall patterns and trends in the data.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
pos_df <- data.frame(
  HOMEPOS = rowSums(stu_df[, c("Possession_book", "Possession_internet", "Possession_phone", 
                                "Possession_software", "Possession_computer", "Possession_room")]),
  Average_Score = stu_df$Average_Score
)

ggplot(data = na.omit(pos_df), aes(x = factor(HOMEPOS), y = Average_Score)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue", outlier.shape = NA) +
  geom_smooth(aes(group = 1), method = "loess", se = FALSE, color = "red", size = 1) +
  labs(x = "HOMEPOS (Binned)", y = "Average Score", title = "Relationship between HOMEPOS and Average Score") +
  theme_minimal()
```

# 4. Key Learning points(with presentation improvement)

In the student's project, which includes plots and plain text, incorporating div elements using RStudio and formatting them with CSS would enhance the presentation. This feature enables the creation of colorful text boxes with borders and background colors, providing an aesthetically appealing and visually engaging layout. Additionally, the use of div elements allows for the insertion of icons, effectively drawing attention to specific content within the project.

The following is the example of the div element.

::: {style="color: black;  background-color:Ivory; border: 15px solid Navy; padding: 15px; margin: 10px;border-radius: 12px;"}
![](images/clipboard-1620020139.png){width="58"}

**Key Learning Point:**

-   When preparing data, it is necessary to simplify complex data by breaking it down into manageable visual elements. Avoid clutter and unnecessary details to make the visualization more accessible and understandable.
-   It is important to conduct purpose-driven visualization. Start by clearly understanding the purpose and intent of the visualization. This will guide the design process and ensures that the visualization effectively communicates the desired message.
-   Recognize that there may be trade-offs between clarity and aesthetics in visualization design. Balancing these elements is crucial for creating visuals that are both visuals that are both visually appealing and effectively convey information.
