For example, we can observe that generally male students have a wider performance spread.\nBoxplots are effective in highlighting any gender-based differences in terms of median and spread. From the box plot with red dot representing mean score, we can conclude that the average performance of female and male are close. Female students have higher mean and median in Reading, male students have better performance in Math and Science.\n\nOutlier Detection:\n\nThe combination of violin and boxplots facilitates easy identification of outliers in each gender category. It can be observed that for each sub-plot, there are outliers at the lower end.\nOutliers can be crucial in understanding extreme scores and potential factors influencing them."

When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation Attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning."

The values of a correlation coefficient ranges between -1.0 and 1.0. A correlation coefficient of 1 shows a perfect linear relationship between the two variables, while a -1.0 shows a perfect inverse relationship between the two variables. A correlation coefficient of 0.0 shows no linear relationship between the two variables.\nWhen multivariate data are used, the correlation coefficeints of the pair comparisons are displayed in a table form known as correlation matrix or scatterplot matrix.\nThere are three broad reasons for computing a correlation matrix.\n\nTo reveal the relationship between high-dimensional variables pair-wisely.\nTo input into other analyses. For example, people commonly use correlation matrices as inputs for exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation models, and linear regression when excluding missing values pairwise.\nAs a diagnostic when checking other analyses. For example, with linear regression a high amount of correlations suggests that the linear regression’s estimates will be unreliable.\n\nWhen the data is large, both in terms of the number of observations and the number of variables, Corrgram tend to be used to visually explore and analyse the structure and the patterns of relations among variables. It is designed based on two main schemes:\n\nRendering the value of a correlation to depict its sign and magnitude, and\nReordering the variables in a correlation matrix so that “similar” variables are positioned adjacently, facilitating perception."

It is designed and maintained by Tal Galili. ### 3.4.1 Working with heatmaply In this section, you will gain hands-on experience on using heatmaply to design an interactive cluster heatmap. We will still use the wh_matrix as the input data.\n\n\nShow the code\nheatmaply(mtcars)\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Seriation\nOne of the problems with hierarchical clustering is that it doesn’t actually place the rows in a definite order, it merely constrains the space of possible orderings. Take three items A, B and C. If you ignore reflections, there are three possible orderings: ABC, ACB, BAC. If clustering them gives you ((A+B)+C) as a tree, you know that C can’t end up between A and B, but it doesn’t tell you which way to flip the A+B cluster. It doesn’t tell you if the ABC ordering will lead to a clearer-looking heatmap than the BAC ordering.\nheatmaply uses the seriation package to find an optimal ordering of rows and columns. Optimal means to optimize the Hamiltonian path length that is restricted by the dendrogram structure. This, in other words, means to rotate the branches so that the sum of distances between each adjacent leaf (label) will be minimized. This is related to a restricted version of the travelling salesman problem.\nHere we meet our first seriation algorithm: Optimal Leaf Ordering (OLO). This algorithm starts with the output of an agglomerative clustering algorithm and produces a unique ordering, one that flips the various branches of the dendrogram around so as to minimize the sum of dissimilarities between adjacent leaves. Here is the result of applying Optimal Leaf Ordering to the same clustering result as the heatmap above.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"OLO\")\n\nError in heatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]), seriate = \"OLO\"): could not find function \"heatmaply\"\n\n\nThe option “mean” gives the output we would get by default from heatmap functions in other packages such as gplots::heatmap.2.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"mean\")\n\nError in heatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]), seriate = \"mean\"): could not find function \"heatmaply\"\n\n\n\n\n3.4.3 Working with colour palettes\nThe default colour palette uses by heatmaply is viridis. heatmaply users, however, can use other colour palettes in order to improve the aestheticness and visual friendliness of the heatmap.\nIn the code chunk below, the Blues colour palette of rColorBrewer is used\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"none\",\n          colors = Blues)\n\nError in heatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]), seriate = \"none\", : could not find function \"heatmaply\"\n\n\n\n\n3.4.4 The finishing touch\nBeside providing a wide collection of arguments for meeting the statistical analysis needs, heatmaply also provides many plotting features to ensure cartographic quality heatmap can be produced.\nIn the code chunk below the following arguments are used:\n\nk_row is used to produce 5 groups.\nmargins is used to change the top margin to 60 and row margin to 200.\nfontsizw_row and fontsize_col are used to change the font size for row and column labels to 4.\nmain is used to write the main title of the plot.\nxlab and ylab are used to write the x-axis and y-axis labels respectively.\n\n\n\nShow the code\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          Colv=NA,\n          seriate = \"none\",\n          colors = Blues,\n          k_row = 5,\n          margins = c(NA,200,60,NA),\n          fontsize_row = 4,\n          fontsize_col = 5,\n          main=\"World Happiness Score and Variables by Country, 2018 \\nDataTransformation using Normalise Method\",\n          xlab = \"World Happiness Indicators\",\n          ylab = \"World Countries\"\n          )\n\n\nError in heatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]), Colv = NA, : could not find function \"heatmaply\""

The core function, namely: treemap() offers at least 43 arguments. In this section, we will only explore the major arguments for designing elegent and yet truthful treemaps.\n\n5.3.1 Designing a static treemap\nThe code chunk below designed a treemap by using three core arguments of treemap(), namely: index, vSize and vColor.\n\n\nShow the code\nrealis2018_selected &lt;- realis2018_summarised %&gt;%\n  filter(`Property Type` == \"Condominium\", `Type of Sale` == \"Resale\")\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the three arguments used:\nindex\n\nThe index vector must consist of at least two column names or else no hierarchy treemap will be plotted.\nIf multiple column names are provided, such as the code chunk above, the first name is the highest aggregation level, the second name the second highest aggregation level, and so on.\n\nvSize\n\nThe column must not contain negative values. This is because it’s vaues will be used to map the sizes of the rectangles of the treemaps.\n\n\n\n5.3.2 Working with vColor and type arguments\nn the code chunk below, type argument is define as value.\n\n\nShow the code\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type = \"value\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.3 Working with algorithm argument and using sortID\nThe code chunk below plots a squarified treemap by changing the algorithm argument. When “pivotSize” algorithm is used, sortID argument can be used to dertemine the order in which the rectangles are placed from top left to bottom right.\n\n\nShow the code\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        algorithm = \"pivotSize\",\n        sortID = \"Median Transacted Price\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )"

theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the density plot above, we can draw the following conclusion:\n\nHigher Schooling Level of Parents:\n\nAs the highest schooling level of parents increases, the density plot shows a tendency towards higher mean performance. This trend is particularly significant for parents who completed &lt;ISCED level 3.3&gt;.\nThis suggests a positive correlation between the educational attainment of parents and the academic performance of students. Students with parents who achieved higher education levels tend to have higher mean scores.\n\nNormal Distribution and Right Skewness:\n\nFor parents with lower schooling levels, the density plot tends to be normal distributed, and as the schooling level decreases further, it becomes right-skewed.\nThis indicates that as the educational background of parents becomes less advanced, the distribution of students’ performance becomes more spread out and right-skewed, with a concentration towards lower scores.\n\nSimilar Mean Performance for Father’s Education:\n\nInterestingly, for fathers who completed &lt;ISCED level 2&gt;, &lt;ISCED level 1&gt;, and did not complete &lt;ISCED level 1&gt;, the students’ mean performance is considered similar. This suggests that, at least in these specific educational levels, education level of father might not be a significant impact on in the academic performance of students for these 3 schooling levels.\n\nMore Significant Impact of Mothers’ Education:\n\nOn the mother’s side, there is a noticeable relationship between higher schooling levels and better student performance. As mothers’ education level increases, the density plot shows a corresponding increase in mean scores.\nThis may implies a stronger influence of mothers’ educational attainment on students’ academic performance compared to fathers.\n\n\nIn summary, the density plot provides insights into the complex relationship between students’ performance and the highest schooling level of parents. It highlights the impact of parental education, with a clear positive association between higher parental education and higher mean performance. The differences observed between mothers and fathers emphasize the varying roles and influences of each parent in shaping students’ academic outcomes.\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Performance distribution by number of book in students’ home\nThe presence of books in a home often reflects a positive educational environment. It can indicate a household that values literacy, learning, and intellectual curiosity.\nUsing density plot, we can visualize how performance is distributed for different student group having different number of books in home.\n\n\n\nNumber of book in students’ home\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n1\nThere are no books\n\n\n2\n1-10 books\n\n\n3\n11-25 books\n\n\n4\n26-100 books\n\n\n5\n101-200 books\n\n\n6\n201-500 books\n\n\n7\nMore than 500 books\n\n\n\n\nAverageReading\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nmean_data &lt;- stu_df %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(Possession_book)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(Possession_book) %&gt;%\n  summarize(mean_value = mean(Average_Score, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nggplot(na.omit(stu_df), aes(x = Average_Score, fill = Possession_book)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_vline(data = mean_data, aes(xintercept = mean_value),\n             color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  facet_wrap(~Possession_book, scales = \"free_y\", ncol = 1) +\n  labs(title = \"Density plot of average score score by number of books owned\",\n       subtitle = \"Red line represents the mean\",\n       x = \"Average Score\",\n       fill = \"number of books owned\") +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"grey45\", high = \"thistle3\") +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 5))+  \n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 0.0055, by = 0.0025))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nmean_data &lt;- stu_df %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(Possession_book)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(Possession_book) %&gt;%\n  summarize(mean_value = mean(Reading_Average, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nggplot(na.omit(stu_df), aes(x = Reading_Average, fill = Possession_book)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_vline(data = mean_data, aes(xintercept = mean_value),\n             color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  facet_wrap(~Possession_book, scales = \"free_y\", ncol = 1) +\n  labs(title = \"Density plot of average reading score score by number of books owned\",\n       subtitle = \"Red line represents the mean\",\n       x = \"Reading average Score\",\n       fill = \"number of books owned\") +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"grey45\", high = \"thistle3\") +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 5))+  \n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 0.0055, by = 0.0025))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the density plot, we can interpret that:\n\nFor students with no books in their homes, the density plot is right-skewed. This suggests that a lack of books is associated with a concentration of lower academic scores. The right skewness indicates that the majority of students in this group may have below-average scores.\nAs the number of books in the home increases, the density plot becomes more left-skewed. This trend suggests a positive correlation between the abundance of books and higher academic performance. The left skewness indicates a concentration of higher scores, with more students performing above the average.\nThe observation that the mean score of students increases as the number of books in the home increases aligns with the general trend of a left-skewed density plot. This indicates that, on average, students with access to a greater number of books tend to achieve higher academic scores.\nA notable deviation from the general trend occurs for students whose homes have “more than 500 books.” In this category, the mean score decreases, contrary to the overall positive relationship observed. This suggests that there may be diminishing returns in terms of academic performance when the number of books surpasses a certain threshold.\n\nIn summary, the density plot illustrates a positive association between the number of books in the home and student performance. However, the deviation observed for the “more than 500 books” category suggests a nuanced relationship, highlighting the need to consider optimal conditions for leveraging the positive influence of books on academic outcomes.\n\n\n4.3.3 Performance distribution by internet access\nAnalyzing student performance by whether the student has internet access provides a comprehensive perspective on the influence of digital resources and technologies on academic outcomes. It helps educators, policymakers, and researchers understand the role of internet access in shaping students’ learning experiences and achievements.\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(na.omit(stu_df), aes(x = as.factor(Possession_internet), y = Average_Score, fill = factor(Possession_internet))) +\n  geom_violin(trim = FALSE) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2, position = position_dodge(width = 0.75)) +\n  stat_summary(\n    fun = median,\n    geom = \"text\",\n    aes(label = round(after_stat(y), )),\n    position = position_dodge(width = 0.75),\n    vjust = 2,\n    size = 3,\n    color = \"black\"\n  ) +\n  stat_summary(\n    fun = mean,\n    geom = \"text\",\n    aes(label = round(after_stat(y), )),\n    position = position_dodge(width = 0.75),\n    vjust = -1,\n    size = 3,\n    color = \"#B00000\"\n  ) +\n   # Add geom_text layer for displaying mean dot in red\n  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = \"point\", shape = 16, size = 3, color = \"#B00000\",\n               position = position_nudge(x = 0.0)) +\n  labs(title = \"Average score Distribution by Internet Access\",\n       subtitle = \"Black text: Median score; Red dot & Red text:Mean score\",\n       x = \"Internet Access\",\n       y = \"Average Score\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"1\" = \"lightcyan2\", \"2\" = \"khaki\"), name = \"Internet Access\", labels = c(\"1\" = \"Yes\", \"2\" = \"No\"))+\n  scale_x_discrete(labels = c(\"No\", \"Yes\"))+\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom above, we can conclude:\n\nMean and Median Comparison:\n\nFor students with no internet access, the mean performance is higher (562) compared to students with internet access (490). However, the median for students with no internet access (572) is higher than the median for students with internet access (471).\n\nWider Score Range with Internet Access:\n\nStudents with internet access exhibit a wider score range compared to those without internet access. The spread of scores is more diverse for students with internet access, indicating greater variability in academic performance.\nThere is a small portion of students with internet access who achieve an average score of 800 or higher. This suggests that, despite the wider score range, there are exceptional cases of very high academic performance among students with internet access.\n\nSkewness of distribution\n\nThe distribution of scores for students with internet access is right-skewed.\nThe distribution of scores for students without internet access is left-skewed. This indicates that a majority of students in this group tend to have above-average scores, with a concentration towards higher performance.\n\n\nIn summary, the violin plot provides a nuanced view of the performance of students based on internet access. It highlights the impact of internet and digital devices on students performance. In this case, Access to internet leads to decrease in performance for students."
